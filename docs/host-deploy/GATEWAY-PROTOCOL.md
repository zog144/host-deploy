# GitHub-to-EC2 gateway protocol v1

This document defines the side-effect-free request and durable state contract used
by the planned GitHub-to-EC2 execution gateway. It does **not** enable AWS access,
SQS consumption, EC2 mutation, or GitHub issue reporting by itself.

The implementation is `zog.host_deploy.gateway.protocol`. Both the GitHub
dispatcher and the persistent command-center consumer must validate the same
contract. The command-center side validates again even after GitHub validation.

## Trust boundary

A request is JSON with a closed schema. Unknown fields and operations are rejected.
Duplicate JSON object keys and non-finite numbers are rejected. The maximum encoded
request size is 16 KiB.

Protocol validation is not authorization. In particular, `origin.trigger_actor`
is audit metadata. The GitHub Actions pass must compare it with the trusted GitHub
event actor and authorize that actor **before** assuming the AWS OIDC role. A label,
issue body, or syntactically valid request never grants authority.

The v1 origin repository is fixed to the private `zog144/host-deploy` repository.

## Request envelope

Every request contains:

- `schema`: integer `1`.
- `request_id`: canonical lowercase 32-hex UUID identity. This is the durable
  external request identity and is not an image-build pipeline ID.
- `workspace_id`: the existing host-deploy workspace identity from
  `workspace.json`.
- `operation`: one of the operations below.
- `origin`: exactly `repository`, positive bounded `issue_number`, and
  `trigger_actor`.
- `parameters`: operation-specific closed parameters.
- `source`: present only for `build.submit`.

`build.submit` source identity is exactly repository `zog144/image-build` plus
a lowercase 40-hex Git commit. Branches, tags and symbolic revisions are not
accepted.

### Operations

| Operation | Parameters | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build.submit` | `{"lane": LANE, "task": NAME}` | Required exact image-build commit |
| `build.status` | `{"lane": LANE, "pipeline_id": ID}` | Forbidden |
| `build.resume` | `{"lane": LANE, "pipeline_id": ID}` | Forbidden |
| `build.cancel` | `{"lane": LANE, "pipeline_id": ID}` | Forbidden |
| `diagnostic.submit` | fixed diagnostic selection | Forbidden |
| `host.status` | `{}` | Forbidden |

Pipeline IDs use image-build's existing canonical lowercase 32-hex pipeline
identity. Every image-build operation also carries a canonical lane name because
pipeline IDs are scoped to an independent box-control/image-build Project. Resume
and cancel deliberately do not accept source replacements.

The initially selectable build-task names are:

- `stages`
- `native-stage`
- `glibc-final`
- `glibc-publish`
- `final-math`
- `final-compiler`

These names originated from maintained image-build worker entry points, but protocol
v1 does not itself define or guess their execution recipe. Pass 4 requires a reviewed
server-owned task catalogue before `build.submit` can be prepared. The catalogue
binds a task to an exact deployed image-build revision and immutable remote-operation
inputs. No default task mappings are shipped, and a task must not be presented as
equivalent to a historical worker until that mapping has been explicitly validated.

The execution adapter owns the actual argv, paths, controller configuration,
timeouts, environment and server-side build profile. Request JSON cannot supply
shell commands, argv, filesystem paths, package target lists, generation selection,
or environment variables.

The v1 diagnostics are `host.runtime` and `build.pipeline`. The latter requires
the exact existing `lane` and `pipeline_id`. Additional diagnostics require an explicit
protocol change; arbitrary commands are not a diagnostic interface.

Example submission:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "request_id": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "workspace_id": "fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210",
  "operation": "build.submit",
  "origin": {
    "repository": "zog144/host-deploy",
    "issue_number": 123,
    "trigger_actor": "zog144"
  },
  "source": {
    "repository": "zog144/image-build",
    "commit": "2222222222222222222222222222222222222222"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "lane": "rebuild-oct1",
    "task": "final-compiler"
  }
}
```

## Durable request state

`new_state(request)` binds the validated request and its canonical SHA-256 digest
into a durable state record. The request bytes are immutable for the lifetime of
that request ID. Reconciliation must never replace source, workspace, operation,
pipeline identity or parameters.

Five state dimensions remain separate:

1. `acceptance`: `received`, `accepted`, `rejected`
2. `admission`: `not_started`, `pending`, `admitted`, `blocked`
3. `dispatch`: `not_started`, `prepared`, `submitted`,
   `submission_uncertain`
4. `completion`: `not_started`, `pending`, `running`, `completed`,
   `failed`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `recovery_blocked`
5. `reporting`: `not_started`, `pending`, `published`, `failed`

Transitions are append-only history entries with RFC3339 UTC timestamps. State
validation replays the complete history and rejects a snapshot that does not match
the replayed result.

Admission cannot start until acceptance. Dispatch cannot prepare until admission.
Completion cannot become pending until dispatch is confirmed `submitted`.
A `submission_uncertain` request therefore cannot be treated as executed; it must
first reconcile the existing remote request. `recovery_blocked` is explicit and
may later reconcile without altering the immutable request binding.

Reporting is deliberately independent. A rejection or admission block may be
reported without dispatch. A running request may be reported and then reported
again after completion. GitHub issue reporting is never the authoritative
execution record.

## Pass-1 scope

This protocol module performs no I/O other than parsing caller-supplied JSON.
It does not create an SQS client, assume AWS roles, run subprocesses, mutate a
workspace, access EC2, or write GitHub issues. Those capabilities are later passes
and must preserve this request binding and transition model.


## Shared-host lane routing

A lane name is lowercase ASCII with hyphens and identifies one independent
box-control Project/image-build state universe on the shared EC2 host. The gateway
must resolve the lane through host-deploy's durable lane registry; request JSON
never supplies project paths, controller sockets, UID/GID values or resource limits.

This prevents a request for one lane from observing or resuming a project-local
pipeline with the same 32-hex ID in another lane. Host-level diagnostics remain
lane-independent.


## 2026-10-19 generic pipeline restriction

The finite `build.submit` task selector now permits only
`xcb-support-image-v1`, representing five explicitly selected XCB support
recipes under a reviewed schema-2 server-owned catalogue. Maintained workers
(`stages`, `glibc-final`, `final-compiler`, etc.) cannot appear as
generic task names. Callers may supply only the task key, exact image-build
source commit and gateway lane; generation/recipes/targets/pin and stage IDs
are controller-owned. See [Generic pipeline dispatch](GATEWAY-GENERIC-PIPELINE.md).
