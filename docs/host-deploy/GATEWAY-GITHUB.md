# GitHub issue dispatcher

This is implementation pass 2 of the GitHub-to-EC2 execution gateway. The workflow
and helper code are developed on `unstable`. GitHub `issues` workflows execute
from the repository default branch, which is currently `main`; therefore the
dispatcher is inert until an explicitly authorized publication to `main`.

The first publication/test must run in **validation-only mode**. Leave repository
variable `ZOG_GATEWAY_SUBMIT_ENABLED` unset or set to anything other than the
exact string `true`. A matching issue will then be checked out, parsed,
authorized, and validated, but the workflow will not invoke the AWS credential
action, request an AWS OIDC token, or send SQS.

## Issue format and authorization

The workflow reacts only to an `issues: opened` event whose body contains the
v1 marker. The body itself must consist only of the marker followed by one
`json` code fence containing the pass-1 request. Extra prose and extra code
fences are rejected.

The trusted GitHub event is authoritative for:

- repository: `zog144/host-deploy`
- issue number
- triggering actor / issue creator

A newly opened issue cannot know its assigned issue number in advance, so issue
content deliberately omits the `origin` field. After actor authorization, the
workflow constructs `origin` exclusively from the trusted event and then runs the
complete pass-1 request validator. Supplying `origin` in issue content is rejected.

Authorized actors are repository-controlled in
`.github/gateway-authorized-actors.json`. The initial list contains only
`zog144`. There are no wildcard actors and issue text cannot add an actor.
The issue marker, title, labels, and request contents are not authorization.

A duplicate request may cause another GitHub workflow invocation. The SQS FIFO
submission uses `request_id` as `MessageDeduplicationId` and `workspace_id`
as `MessageGroupId`, but the future persistent consumer must still enforce
application-level request idempotency because the FIFO deduplication window is
not a durable ledger.

## Enabling the SQS test

Only after the validation-only issue succeeds, configure these repository
Actions secrets and the explicit live-dispatch variable:

- secret `ZOG_GITHUB_DISPATCH_ROLE_ARN`: ARN of the existing
  `zog-github-dispatch` IAM role.
- secret `ZOG_BUILD_REQUEST_QUEUE_URL`: either the exact SQS queue ARN or exact
  HTTPS queue URL for `zog-build-requests.fifo` in `us-east-1`.
- variable `ZOG_GATEWAY_SUBMIT_ENABLED=true`: explicit live-dispatch gate.

The queue target is canonicalized to
`https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<12-digit-account>/zog-build-requests.fifo`.
Only the exact `us-east-1` FIFO ARN/URL is accepted.

The workflow uses GitHub OIDC and no stored AWS access key. Actor authorization
and request validation occur before the AWS credentials step. The configured
role must remain limited to `sqs:SendMessage` for the primary queue.

The AWS credential action is pinned to the immutable `v6.3.0` release tag.
GitHub-owned checkout/setup actions currently follow the repository's existing
major-version convention.

## SQS message binding

The SQS body is the canonical validated protocol JSON. Submission sets:

- FIFO message group: exact `workspace_id`
- FIFO deduplication ID: exact `request_id`

The helper logs only a bounded request summary and the SQS FIFO receipt. It does
not log arbitrary issue prose.

No GitHub issue completion comment is produced in pass 2; reporting is a later
gateway pass, and the issue is never the authoritative execution record.
